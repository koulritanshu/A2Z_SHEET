1. Djikstra Algorithm fails on two cases:

    a) If the graph contains negative edges, then the solution generated using
       Djikstra won't be correct.

    b) If the graph contains negative cycles, then the Djikstra algorithm will
       never terminate

2. Bellman Ford algorithm can be used to make sure that the graph works correctly
   for negative edges and it can be used to detect negative cycles if the graph
   contains one.

3. Bellman ford algorithm states that the relaxation step will take place (n-1)
   times because in the worst case at each step only one value in the distance
   vector will change.

   Relaxation Step: if(dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[u] + c < dist[v]) dist[v] = dist[u] + c;

4. If on performing relaxation at the nth step a change in the distance vector
   takes place, that means the graph contains negative cycles because according to
   the worst case, all the changes must have happened till the (n-1)th iteration.
